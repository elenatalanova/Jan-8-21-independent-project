  <h1>Shortly about myself</h1>
  <p>I am a Ukrainian girl, 29 years old, who moved to USA 5 years ago. I came here alone and have started my life from scratch in this wonderful place calle Pacific North West, learning english, culture, laws and life itself. In Ukraine I got a Masters degree in journalism (studied Slavic languages) and worked at the city local TV-channels, creating daily news. Since I moved to US I find out that my liguistic skill absolutely useless in term of providing decent living conditions, so I've decided to challenge myself and change my career path drastically. During last couple years living in Seattle I made many friends in tech field and they all seemd like very intelligent and fun personalities to be around. The more I was watching them code, the more I was curious about how this system works and here I am, finally decided to go there and learn it myself.</p>
