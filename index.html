    <h1>Shortly about myself</h1>
     <p>I am a Ukrainian girl, 29 years old, who moved to USA 5 years ago. I came here alone and have started my life from scratch in this wonderful place calle Pacific North West, learning english, culture, laws and life itself. In Ukraine I got a Masters degree in <span class="highlight">journalism</span> (studied Slavic languages) and worked at the city local TV-channels, creating daily news. Since I moved to US I foun my linguistic skills absolutely useless in term of providing decent living conditions, so I've decided to challenge myself and <span class="highlight">change my career path drastically</span>. During last couple years living in Seattle I made many friends in <span class="highlight">tech field</span> and they all seemd like very intelligent and fun personalities to be around. The more I was watching them code, the more I was curious about how this system works and here I am, finally decided to go there and learn it myself.</p></div>
